                                    INTRODUCTION
Stock price prediction has been a critical area of research in finance, and machine learning has
emerged as a powerful tool to tackle this complex problem. The ability to accurately predict
stock prices can have a significant impact on investment decisions, allowing investors to
maximize returns and minimize losses. However, stock price prediction is a challenging task
due to the dynamic and volatile nature of the stock market, influenced by a multitude of
factors including economic indicators, company performance, and market sentiment.
In recent years, machine learning algorithms have shown promising results in stock price
prediction, outperforming traditional statistical models in many cases. This is due to their
ability to learn patterns and relationships in large datasets, handle non-linear relationships, and
adapt to changing market conditions. Among various machine learning algorithms, Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have gained popularity in stock price prediction due to
their ability to handle time-series data and capture long-term dependencies.
In this abstract, we will explore the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly
LSTM networks, to stock price prediction. We will discuss the importance of stock price
prediction, the challenges involved, and the potential benefits of using machine learning
algorithms in this domain.

                                   Problem Statement
The point of the task is to ascertain or anticipate the future stock costs of organizations
utilizing an alternate number of AI and estimating strategies reliant on authentic returns just as
numerical news markers to fabricate an arrangement of numerous or different stocks so as to
expand the issue. We do this by putting managed learning techniques for stock value
anticipating by understanding the idea of dataset.
